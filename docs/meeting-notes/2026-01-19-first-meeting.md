## Notes

### Project Overview

- This is a 10-week project
- Could potentially lead to seminar presentation or publication
- Peer evaluation will be conducted at the end

### Dataset

- **Highest priority:** Find an available dataset
- Need to understand dataset characteristics (size, labels, format)
- Eliminate unknown/unreliable sources

### Models

- Each person picks one model to investigate
- For each model:
  - Check the paper
  - Find the GitHub repo
  - Check if pretrained weights are available
- Focus on understanding before running

### Environment Setup

- Install OpenCV (everyone)
- Set up Python environment
- Check GPU availability if needed

### Scope Clarification

- No need to work on frontend for now
- Focus on detection models and documentation

## Decisions

- Weekly meeting: **Monday 10:00–10:30**
- Each team member owns one model
- Dataset selection is the first priority

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Research dataset candidates | All | Week 1 |
| Pick a model to investigate | Each member | Week 1 |
| Install OpenCV and verify | All | Week 1 |
| Find instructions for OpenCV installation |  | Week 1 |
